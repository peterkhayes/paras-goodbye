Looking forward to meeting up the next time you're home in NY :)",Loren:"Paras! I've felt your impact here in three ways: 1. great music recommendations, 2. the kind closeness of the transit team, 3. the joy I got from hanging out in person and over zoom. You'll be missed, good luck on the new adventure",Peter:"It has been an absolute time working with you these last couple of years.

In particular I am so grateful that I had the opportunity to partner with you as team leads for the Transit team.  I have learned so much from you and know I am a better PM thanks to your feedback and teamwork.  Your impact on this team is strongly felt: your EM leadership has resulted in a team that prioritizes pairing and discourages heroics.  Thank you so much for everything you have brought to this team and best of luck with your next adventure.","Stuart C":"Paras, you've had a huge impact on the team. It's been a true pleasure working with you and I sincerely hope we can do it again someday.
